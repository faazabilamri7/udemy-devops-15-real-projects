# Lab 013: Develop a Java Application in Kubernetes for Monitoring ConfigMap Modifications and Content Changes

## Lab Goal

In this lab, we will learn how to develop a **Java application** that interacts with the Kubernetes API to **monitor changes** to a file that is mounted by a **ConfigMap**.

<!--
It is important to note that **the file mounted by the ConfigMap is mounted as a symbolic link** (e.g. `/config/game.properties` -> `/config/..data/game.properties`-> `/config/..2023_03_02_15_51_59.1603915861/game.properties`), so your Java code should read the **symlink** instead of the file directly.
