# Lab 015: Remove Large File from Git Commit History

## Lab Goal

This lab specifically focuses on the process of removing large file objects from the Git history.

**Be warned: this technique is destructive to your commit history.**

We have to notify all contributors that they must rebase their work onto our new commits.
